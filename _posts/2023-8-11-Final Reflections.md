 It’s the end of the program, but not the end of the Open Source journey. I started eight weeks ago with the goal of picking up on networking skills and being able to document better, but I gained much more. I’m happy to say I’ve improved my documentation skills enough to where I am able to get my point across, and others can understand the context of the information I have gathered. I believe this came about mostly from having to spend some number of hours looking at other issues, speaking in group meetings where we had to jot down notes, and creating pull-requests where I had to document my process to live on the site forever. If I had to put the skill on a scale, I would say I started with a 2 and it went up to a 5, but I still have a ways to go to 10. Looking towards the future, I think I can better this skill I've gained in open source by applying it to other fields. 

 Without focusing on a particular skill, I’d say the Catalyst program has overall made me a better coder, designer, and researcher. Throughout all of my experience in the program, working with a team has opened me to new perspectives of solving a particular problem. Not only that, but it allowed me to explore ideas that were slightly outside of my skill set, and improve on my communication for the ideas that I did have. In terms of code, I had to always keep in mind that others would read it, so I made it a habit to add inline documentation to the lines of code I developed. As a designer, communication is a huge thing, I was able to improve on synthesizing information and ideas within the team to determine what was possible with our collective skillset. Finally, as a researcher, I was able to dive into new concepts that I was unfamiliar with and gain a knack for how to find certain bits of information that would help me solve a problem.

 After a while of getting familiar with projects we got to choose to work on a big project of our own, the p5js repo. We chose this project because of its community engagement, the amount of documentation available, and because it had to do with art. Throughout the program, I was able to work on fixing wording in the developer notes, fixing reference descriptions in Spanish, fixing the search bar text on the homepage of their website, and proposing new ideas for the documentation templates. It's worth noting that, apart from the Spanish descriptions, I worked on all of the issues by consulting the team and I would ask for help in making sure my writing was always understandable to others. In the end, I believe working with all of the team was very productive in terms of creating a contribution with a higher likelihood of acceptance to the project.

 The most challenging issue was the Search bar issue, as it took me a number of days and steps to find the answer I was looking for. The issue was that the search bar placeholder text on the p5js.org website read “Search p5js.org” in English, for all of the available languages to translate the site. Once I observed this behavior, I took to the p5js-website repo to open an issue and inform the community of what was going on; a few days later, I was assigned to work on it. It took me a few days to find the correct file that rendered the homepage among my local copy of the repository, and from there, it took me another number of days to understand where the search bar element was being rendered from. Luckily, I had a classmate help me after a few days of struggling and he pointed out a potential solution to use existing HTML variables and produce a new variable named “search-bar” to render the placeholder text for all languages. From there, it was a matter of minutes before we were able to implement a solution to the problem. In the end, I was able to open a fully functional non-conflicting pull-request, that is still under review, but from the looks of it will be approved in a matter of time.

 My most rewarding issue was being able to work on the Spanish code reference for the p5js.org website. The code reference is a section of the website that contains a detailed description and examples of functions in the p5js library. The issue was that the reference in Spanish contained many descriptions that were fully in English, half-English, or had missing links to other functions within the reference. I first started by commenting under an existing issue for this on the p5js-website repo, where some Spanish-speaking stewards and maintainers already had a to-do list of the remaining functions to be fixed. In my position as a new contributor, I decided to tackle the 2D Primitives section and fix the descriptions for all of the functions under the category before proceeding with more fixes. I was able to easily find the location of each description within my local copy of the repository and tested fixes by running a local version of the site to view in-progress changes. In the end, I was able to produce a fix to the entire category and posted a lengthy pull-request to the existing issue with no conflicts. It is my most rewarding contribution by far, both because it is my longest pull-request and it is an issue I was able to work on solely based on my fluency in my primary language. 

 After a two month period as a Catalyst Fellow, I'd say the most interesting thing has been finding out I have a personal interest in research and other fields of computer science. I have always seen other fields as another barrier to climb in my career, yet found there are many I am able to overcome with my current skill set, as long as I give it a shot. I feel that I have enough experience in open source to comfortably walk into other projects, and quickly navigate their community with a goal in mind. Thanks to the program, I was able to familiarize myself with the basic structure of open source communities. While not all communities will be as easy to work with as the ones I have experienced, I plan to continue to look for other places to engage in and improve my abilities of problem solving, documentating, and networking. Particularly, I want to make a list of the kinds of projects that pique my interest and try to find a project to fit each one. Since starting my computer science bachelors, I’ve always dived head-first into things that give me a good gut feeling for improvement, and I can say that working on numerous projects based on my interests is something that I know will produce positive results in my near future.

 If in any way possible I am able to remain engaged to the Open Source Catalyst program in the future, I would be happy to. So far I am only able to say positive things about my first experience in open source and my trip to UCSC. Soon I will make the leap to engage with the tech-industry in my first computer science related job and I hope I am able to improve my skills so much that I can give back to those who helped me get there. Another thing that would be fun would be to join a conference, similar to those I attended during my period in Santa Cruz, so I can meet new people and other great ideas within the field. I’d say that the Open Source Catalyst program definitely has room to grow, but I think what it has so far works very well in all of its aspects. I may be a bit biased at this point, but I believe it is a strong program that should definitely receive more engagement in the future. If it was a repository, one new feature request I would add is to permanently add a planned visit to a tech company, as it was a good experience to see how people are able to engage together at an office and contrast to the workflow found in a smaller open source team or online community.

 Overall, the UCSC Open Source Catalyst program was a fun, fruitful, and worthwhile experience. I was able to go to new places I had never been, experience a new field of computer science, and create some connections that I hope will take me a long way. I feel a lot more confident that I am able to securely move into a team-based environment when I decide to move to work in industry and I feel more confident in my ability to figure more things out on my own. I have had bad experiences with applying to internships in the past, and ironically the Catalyst program was the catalyst I needed to push further for other opportunities. I give a huge thank you to the team and my coordinator for making my 2023 summer a great one. I wish them all well and I hope that we can all have a bright future in the field from here on out. After two hard working months, all that is left to say is.. GO SLUGS!
