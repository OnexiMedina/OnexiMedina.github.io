I am Onexi, a Senior Computer Science student from Norfolk State University. I am currently participating in a Summer Open Source Research program in order to expand on my skills as a coder. Additionally, I have experience in UX/UI from my past bootcamp, which lasted a full year, and I was lucky enough to do under Netflix. As for other things, I have also participated in some Cybersecurity competitions and have come out victorious in the past year.

I have never had any experiences with open source prior to joining the OSRE group. However, I have had encounters with open source software in the past, particularly those that are available to install games and other useful software onto my personal computers. The concept of open source is something that draws my attention, because it allows for rapid development of features that a one-man team might not be able to do aline. For that reason. I decided to dive into research related to this field, to see what skills it can bring to me; as I believe that no matter what field you are looking to within CS, every new skill will make you a better developer.

As part of a team, I believe I can bring a strong sense of adaptability and cohesion amongst the members. Based on my experience within UX/UI, I have developed a sense of being able to adapt my current skills to new problems, and being able to identify what skills others are best at to get the job done. Consequently, I am also able to better understand the ideas that others bring forward, and can quickly find ways to have others find common ground.

That said, I know I have much to improve upon, including my documentation and organizational skills. Not only that, I also hope to improve my conversational/networking skills. I am very comfortable with generating new ideas and being able to converse about problems, but I run into issues when it comes to documenting, or writing down every single detail of a project that will be worked on in the future.
