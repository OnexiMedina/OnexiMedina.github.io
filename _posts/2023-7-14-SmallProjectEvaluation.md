Today I took the time to evaluate a project named OpenSSF Scorecard, which is “an automated tool that assesses a number of important heuristics ("checks") associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10”. The purpose is to “use these scores to understand specific areas to improve in order to strengthen the security posture of your project”. Additionally, you can “assess the risks that dependencies introduce, and make informed decisions about accepting these risks, evaluating alternative solutions, or working with the maintainers to make improvements”, according to their Scorecard’s project overview. 

The project itself seems to be active, even though it is a smaller community, there are multiple issues posted as of recent on their issues page and each of them have numerous replies. Currently, there are 113 established contributors and a total of 37 users to date. If I was to make a contribution to the Scorecard project, I would scroll through their documentation for new contributors and read up on everything I need to know before gathering context. Later on, I would read through their issues to see if there is one I can identify with enough context to continue investigating on how I can contribute. Finally, if possible, I would seek to get in touch with a maintainer to start a discussion on how I can meaningfully impact the project.

Documentation for this project is very abundant, including specific documents for things such as prerequisites, installation, authentication, usage, and more. As for bugs and features, they are tracked using Github’s issue tracker. There are a great number of issues open (368 to be exact), though I do believe this is normal to have given that it is a continually growing project. From what can be observed, it seems the issues are being addressed, given the amount of engagement in the issue tracker, and the amount of issues that have been closed (more than 10 in the past month).

If I was to install this application, I believe it would only take a few minutes to get through most of the installation. As for being able to use it, I reckon it might be closer to about an hour, to get familiar with the basic functionality of the software. In case I need any help with troubleshooting, I would most likely refer to their [slack channel](https://slack.openssf.org/#security_scorecards) to get further assistance, as that is where the members communicate with one another on a frequent basis. Furthermore, there are also a number of other resources to meet and talk with community people, including a [zoom link](https://zoom.us/j/98835923979) and a [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

Overall, the most interesting thing I have learned from evaluating a small open source project is how the community engagement looks. Even though it is a small group, the members seem to have built a system that keeps the people engaged and making advances on the software. It seems to be something that will continue to grow in the next few months at least, and is a project that I will continue to monitor in the near future.
