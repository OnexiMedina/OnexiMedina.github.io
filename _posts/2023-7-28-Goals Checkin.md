  As of today, I have had numerous experiences interfacing with an open source community known as P5.js. So far, I have read through their documentation, observed community interaction between members and stewards, and looked for areas to make a potential contribution. Additionally, I’ve opened up two issues, one related to their developer notes on the main [P5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) repo, and another relating to Spanish translation of their code reference on the [P5.js-website](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website) repo. I am currently waiting to hear back from the community for feedback, and hope to soon have my first contribution merged into the project.

  In the next two weeks, I look forward to learning more about the way the community manages code contributions and how I can potentially make one of my own. It has been a bit challenging so far to get my “foot in the door”, so to speak, but I believe that will change in  the coming weeks. Code is quite a step-up from fixing the documentation for a large project, yet I am hopeful I can find something that is within my current skill set or just outside of my reach to be able to grow into it in this short period.
  
  At the beginning of the OSRE program, I sought to better my organizational and documenting skills. Today, I can say I have made some progress towards that goal, as I feel much more confident in my ability to quickly compile information and synthesize it together to create an issue request, a report, or any other documentation to help solve a problem. To continue to progress this goal, I will do my best to open shared documents or Trello cards to display information for my team during meetings and group-work sessions. Finally, I hope that I can continue to rely on my open source mentor to revise wording and provide feedback on my ideas throughout the remainder of the program.
