  Since starting my open source journey, I have had the luck of interacting with How To Open Source, by Richard Schneeman. A book that, much like the author, has lots of personality and speaks about open source in a way that is very inviting to a new-comer like me. There were lots of concepts that spoke to me in his passages, but in particular, the idea of “thinking like a maintainer” really stuck with me. I found it as very straightforward advice, but with lots of practical applications, because it helped me see new opportunities within open source projects from a different perspective. Working on something you didn’t create can make ideating feel very foreign, but when you think as if the project is yours, it removes the invisible blocker in your brain and lets new ideas flow. So far, I have had the opportunity to feel like a maintainer and work on a handful of issues in the P5.js repo. However, in the future I plan to look at new projects, ones that will require me to adopt a different maintainer mindset and grow my skills for a new community.

  After having the opportunity to speak with the author himself, I was able to learn some interesting anecdotes about his life. Among them, I learned that at the beginning of his open source career, he used to “act as if people can always see your code”. I believe this means that, to create great code, it must be something that others have the ability to understand by looking at it. That said, I think this kind of mindset is useful for things that are not code as well. Keeping this in mind, If I was to write code now, I’d document my code better, make sure things are organized appropriately, and overall make it possible for the most amount of people to understand my code just by taking a look at it.

  As a line from the book, Richard says: “The longer I’ve been employed as a professional coder, the more I realize that I’m paid for my ability to figure out things that I do not know quickly.” From my experience, both in the Catalyst program and in other projects relating to the Tech Industry, the statement from Richard is very accurate. That said, I believe it is a good thing to always have something different to work on, as it keeps you growing as a professional and takes the boring-ness out of most work. If working in tech did not constitute working on a random mix of different fields for a particular project, it is safe to say I would not be a coder at all. 

  I am glad I have had the opportunity to both read the book and speak with a great mind while entering the field of open source. I believe I have made a stronger connection with the team that I work with, and the project we are working on, because of the book. I am not very much of a reader, but it has been fun experiencing some of the anecdotes through my own project and seeing how they align. I believe I can say I’ve had a great head-start into open source and hope to continue this endeavor in the future beyond the program. I have made many great connections since the start of the journey, and more than that, I am glad I started with the Catalyst program and have had the team that I have along the way.
