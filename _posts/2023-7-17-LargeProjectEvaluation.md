A few days ago, along with the Small-Scale Project Evaluation, I took the time to evaluate a project named P5.js, which is a “JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else”; according to their project overview. It is a considerably larger project than that of Open SSF at the moment, but has many similarities. The project has seen lots of recent activity, and there are multiple issues posted on their issues page, each of them containing numerous replies. Currently, there are 530 established contributors and a total of 16,400 users to date. 

If I was to make a contribution to the P5.js project, I would go to the All Contributors website and read the documentation for new contributors. My next step would be to read through their issues to gather context and information on how people contribute to their project. Furthermore, I would filter their issues by tags, and find one that is labeled as “beginner friendly” to see if I can help with something they are requesting. Finally, if possible, I would seek to get in touch with an experienced contributor or maintainer,  to start a discussion on how I can meaningfully impact the project.

P5.js itself is very well documented, including specific documents for things such as a [code of conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [contributor documentation](https://p5js.org/contributor-docs/#/), [code guide](https://p5js.org/reference), [libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries), [coding tutorials](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/), and more. In order to track bugs and features, they are using Github’s [issue tracker](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues). They seem to be on a steady track given the amount of issues they have open (195) and the amount they have closed (3,311). Many requests seem to be getting lots of attention, and the issues are being addressed as they appear on the tracker. Installation of the software doesn’t take any time at all, the readme file in the official repository has it linked multiple times as an online tool, hosted on its own website. The app is straightforward and simple to understand, with a refreshing user interface. However, if you find yourself unable to understand the software, you can communicate with members via the [community forum](https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10). 

Overall, the most interesting thing I have learned from evaluating a large open source project like P5.js is how their community engages from multiple platforms. As the project has expanded, they have made the project’s github page solely for code, and made a website for users to see documentation and be able to use their software. Not to mention, they have a separate community forum for other communications. 

Comparing the large-scale project against the small-scale project, I find myself leaning more towards P5.js, because it is part of a community I am more likely to engage in, art. Both projects have comparable activity and overall good communication, while the smaller-scale project has more issues, it seems to have a better system to send tickets with more context and detailed information. On the other hand, the bigger project excels in documentation, and overall ease of use. Having a software that doesn’t need to be installed is a plus, and it seems to be in a more stable phase of the project’s life cycle than the OpenSSF Scorecard project. That said, If I had to pick a project to contribute to, I would spend my time looking through P5.js.
