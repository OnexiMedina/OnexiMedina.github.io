  Today, I read a chapter from the Open Advice book under Infrastructure titled, “Backups to Maintain Sanity”. It was a rather quirky title, so I gave it a read and found some surprisingly good advice. The passage talks about how having a stable data backup of an existing project can help a project advance forward much quicker. In projects with more resources, or a larger budget, there often exists a copy of the project that is stable, and another copy, in a separate environment, that is used for constant experimentation. For smaller projects, experimentation with the existing stable version is harder to do, given that they don’t have a separate environment to experiment on their code. However, with data backups, a smaller project can progress quickly and make changes without the fear of losing their work. A fun analogy that is used to describe this is: “People tend to play a game differently when they have infinite lives as compared to needing to start over from the start as soon as one mistake is made”.
 
  In terms of advice for people within tech, I’d say having data backups is one of the most fundamental things to do and often gets overlooked. I am one that is guilty of not having enough backups for my data, but I do have some for certain projects. That said, if I would like to start to become a better coder, create a project for others to use, or conduct rapid experimentation, I would go along with the author’s advice. It seems that it would be a good stress reliever, and in times of need, a lifeline to have a backup in case all of the data you have gets erased.

  If I was to step into the author’s shoes and provide someone who is starting in open source some advice, I’d mainly say to “stick to one thing”. To clarify, I would advise a beginner to pick a language they are very familiar with, and the field they are most familiar with to then tackle an issue. When getting into open source, I find it very helpful to stick to a particular area to gather context, especially, if that area falls within your skillset. No matter the project that you go to, you will be a beginner, but if you stick to one thing you can quickly get familiar with other surrounding issues in the process.
